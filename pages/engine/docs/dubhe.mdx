# Introduction

## What is the Polis?
Polis is a modular application development engine composed of a series of toolchains and libraries, designed to simplify modular application development. Users can leverage this engine to develop various applications, which can be entirely or partially built on a modular blockchain network.

## Polis Architecture?

* [Schema](/engine/docs/poils/schemas) provides abstractions specifically designed for storing and retrieving data from a on-chain permanent storage.
* [CLI](/engine/docs/poils/cli) is a modular blockchain game rendering engine with built-in cryptographic libraries and Polis SDK integration.
* [Client](/engine/docs/poils/client) is a modular network rollup framework based on verifiable fully homomorphic encryption (V-FHE), integrating ZK and FHE technologies.
* [Indexer](https://github.com/0xobelisk/Dubhe) is a modular network rollup framework based on verifiable fully homomorphic encryption (V-FHE), integrating ZK and FHE technologies.
* [Create-Obelisk](https://github.com/0xobelisk/Dubhe) is a modular network rollup framework based on verifiable fully homomorphic encryption (V-FHE), integrating ZK and FHE technologies.
